# Discord Eurobeat Radio Bot
A Discord bot coded in Python to play the Eurobeat Radio!

**READ ME**

I **do not** own Eurobeat Radio! All the credit goes to Avex Inc. and HI.BPM-STUDIO.

Thanks to **R.K. Coding** for an amazing music bot tutorial. If you like this bot make sure to subscribe to his.

I only made this for my own Discord server but also to be used as example code for other people that want to have some example code for a radio.

If you want to have Eurobeat Radio on your Server right now you can add my bot to your Discord Server

**I highly suggest using this tutorial to make a bot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKcBy06fLQY&t=577s**
